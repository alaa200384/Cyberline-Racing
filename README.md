# ABOUT:

Cyberline Racing is an action-heavy vehicular combat racing video game developed by MagicIndie Softworks and released in 2017 for PC platforms like Windows and macOS (also previously on mobile 2015 - 2017).

At first glance, the game looks like a traditional race—but it quickly becomes clear that it’s much more than just speed. Cyberline Racing blends high-octane racing with relentless combat, creating a race-to-the-death experience where offensive driving is just as important as finishing first.

The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where society has collapsed due to greed, warfare, and corporate corruption. Outlaws, androids, and desperate survivors populate this broken world. In an effort to both entertain and test new weapons technologies, a powerful organization called Cyberline Corp organizes death races—brutal competitions where drivers don’t just race, they fight for survival.

You take on the role of one of the contestants—each with their own grim backstory and motives for entering the lethal tournament. Throughout the campaign, you face off against numerous opponents controlled by the game’s AI, each as deadly and determined as you.

What makes Cyberline Racing distinct is its fusion of racing and shooter mechanics:

- Combat-Loaded Vehicles: Every car isn’t just for driving—it’s outfitted with a vast arsenal of weapons like machine guns, lasers, and plasma launchers. You use these to attack rivals, defend yourself, and clear the way to victory.

- Fast-Paced Races: Tracks are set in diverse and dangerous environments, from cyberpunk city slums and snowy mountain passes to volcanic islands and abandoned military zones.

- Customization: As you progress, you unlock and upgrade over 30 different combat vehicles, modifying weapons, performance, and defensive systems to suit your playstyle.

- Multiple Modes: The game supports both single-player and online multiplayer modes, complete with leaderboards that track global performance.

While not a big-budget title, Cyberline Racing embraces a gritty cyberpunk aesthetic—a world of neon, ruin, and perpetual danger. The graphics and sound design aim to support the chaotic atmosphere of high-pressure combat racing, though the style and polish reflect its indie origins.

Since its release, Cyberline Racing has maintained a presence on platforms like Steam, where players enjoy its frantic mix of combat and racing for a very modest price. Its reception has skewed mostly positive among users who appreciate its indie charm and addictive race-and-blast formula, even if it doesn’t match the sophistication of larger AAA racers.


## SERVER ERROR FIX:

The Servers were taken down by the end of 2022. To this day, the servers never came back online. So I decided to make the game playable again, without a server needed. You can now play the game normally and access every other stuff (except multiplayer, because at the moment, there is no server for this). You still need to be connected to your internet (only for Junkyard for now).

## IMPORTANT NOTE: 
You need to buy the game from steam. Then you need to go to: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cyberline Racing\game_Data\Managed\" and find "Assembly-CSharp.dll". Replace it with the .dll file you downloaded from the releases.
